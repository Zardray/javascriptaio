# JavaScript All-in-One For Dummies

I'm learning JavaScript, React, Vue, Svelte, and Node from JavaScript All-in-One For Dummies by Chris Minnick. I'm an Ops guy, so yes, I need a book for dummies to do this. My shop uses Angular so I may have bought the wrong book but learning other frameworks can't hurt I suppose!

I'm doing this because I know that dev-ops is here. It's not the future anymore, it's here. As an applications administrator, I need to be able to understand what's under the hood of the applications I handle (and tweak them as necessary, if possible). Better yet, being able to create simple apps and integrate them into existing services is something that I'm sure will delight my end-users. And with AI making it easier than ever to generate, modify, clarify, and improve code, I figure there's no time like the present to learn these valuable skills.
