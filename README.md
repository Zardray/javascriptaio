# JavaScript All-in-One For Dummies

I'm learning JavaScript, React, Vue, Svelte, and Node from JavaScript All-in-One For Dummies by Chris Minnick. I'm an Ops guy, so yes, I need a book for dummies to do this. My shop uses Angular so I may have bought the wrong book but learning other frameworks can't hurt I suppose!
